## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teknolista/teknolista/main/assets/hand-waving.gif" width="30px">&nbsp; Hi there!

<p align="justify">Welcome to my developer page on GitHub! My name is <b>Raul Bras</b> and I live in this surreal country we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil">Brasil</a>. I have a degree in information technology (computer science), and I work in the business intelligence segment as a <i>full-stack web developer</i>. In my free time, I like to study new programming languages and code machine learning using Python.</p>

## ðŸ”°&nbsp; The [NeoBASIC 4GL](https://github.com/neobasic) Project

<p align="justify">Iâ€™m currently working on a new programming language called <a href="https://github.com/neobasic">NeoBASIC</a>. It is a high-level language of the fourth generation that is easy to learn and code. It is also a language that can be used to create games, apps, and other software. If you're interested in learning more, feel free to get in touch on any of the social networks in my profile. Your comments and suggestions are always welcome.</p>
