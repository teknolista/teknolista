##  ðŸ‘‹


Iâ€™m currently working on a new programming language called [NeoBASIC](https://github.com/neobasic) that is a fourth generation programming language. It is a high level language that is easy to learn and use. It is also a language that can be used to create games, apps, and other software. You can contact me on any of the social networks in my profile. Your comments and suggestions are always welcome.
